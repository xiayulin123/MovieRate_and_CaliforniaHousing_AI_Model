<h1 align="center" id="title">Predictive Modeling: Movie Ratings and California Housing Prices</h1>

# Project Introduction:
Welcome to our GitHub project! This repository contains two AI models: one for movie rating prediction (Movie_Rate) and the other for California housing price estimation (California_Housing). Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we collect datasets from sources like Kaggle to train and optimize these models, creating highly efficient and accurate prediction models.

## Key Stages

### Movie Rating Prediction Model (Movie_Rate):

- **Data Collection:** We gather extensive movie-related data, including movie features and user ratings, from resources like Kaggle.
- **Data Preprocessing:** We perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and conduct necessary feature engineering on the movie dataset.
- **Model Training:** The movie rating prediction model is trained using algorithms such as linear regression and random forest regression.
- **Model Selection and Optimization:** We employ techniques like grid search to optimize model parameters and enhance prediction performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Various evaluation metrics are employed to assess the model's prediction accuracy and generalization capability.

### California Housing Price Estimation Model (California_Housing):

- **Data Collection:** We collect housing data from various sources across California, encompassing housing features and sale prices.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The housing data undergoes cleaning, handling of missing values, and necessary feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** The housing price estimation model is trained using algorithms such as linear regression and random forest regression.
- **Model Selection and Optimization:** Techniques like grid search are utilized to optimize model parameters and improve prediction performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Multiple evaluation metrics are used to assess the model's prediction accuracy and generalization capability.
