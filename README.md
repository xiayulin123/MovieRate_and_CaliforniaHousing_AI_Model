## üöÄ Project Introduction

Welcome to our GitHub project! This repository contains two AI models: one for predicting movie ratings (Movie_Rate) and the other for estimating California housing prices (California_Housing). Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we collect datasets from sources like Kaggle to train and optimize these models, creating highly efficient and accurate prediction models.

## Key Stages

### Movie Rating Prediction Model (Movie_Rate):

- **Data Collection:** Gather extensive movie-related data, including movie features and user ratings, from sources like Kaggle.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and handle missing values, and perform necessary feature engineering on the movie dataset.
- **Model Training:** Train the movie rating prediction model using algorithms like linear regression and random forest regression.
- **Model Selection and Optimization:** Utilize techniques like grid search to optimize model parameters and enhance prediction performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Employ various evaluation metrics to assess prediction accuracy and generalization capability.

### California Housing Price Estimation Model (California_Housing):

- **Data Collection:** Collect housing data from various sources across California, covering housing features and sale prices.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, handle missing values, and perform necessary feature engineering on the housing data.
- **Model Training:** Train the housing price estimation model using algorithms like linear regression and random forest regression.
- **Model Selection and Optimization:** Use techniques like grid search to optimize model parameters and improve prediction performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilize multiple evaluation metrics to assess prediction accuracy and generalization capability.
